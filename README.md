Ginatra
=======

This project  is to make a  clone of gitweb in  Ruby and Sinatra. It  serves git
repositories out  of a specified  directory at the moment,  but i have  plans to
make  it function  just  as gitweb  does, including  leeching  config files  and
suchlike.

Installation
------------

You should be using Git 1.6.3 or later just to be sure that it all works:

    $ git --version
    git version 1.6.3

You'll need a few gems just to serve git repositories, for page caching, syntax highlighting & a sinatra daemon runner:

    $ (sudo) gem install grit kematzy-sinatra-cache coderay vegas

To run the test suite, you also need:

    $ (sudo) gem install rspec webrat rack-test cucumber

To do both these steps more quickly, run the following rake tasks:

    $ rake setup:gems
    $ rake setup:test
    
Then clone this repository:

    $ git clone git://github.com/lenary/ginatra.git
    
You'll  also need  to  (`--bare`) clone  `atmos/hancock-client`  into the  repos
directory and call it test: (don't ask, it was just a repo i chose at random)

    $ cd repos && git clone --bare git://github.com/atmos/hancock-client.git test.git

This can be done much quicker by doing the following rake task

    $ rake setup:repo
    
Usage
-----
        
If you're just using it in development, use the following to run Ginatra:

    $ ruby ginatra.rb
    
Ginatra  also runs  on thin.  **BEWARE:** There  are issues  running Ginatra  on
Passenger. We discourage Ginatra's use on Passenger until we can make it stable.

I have made a rake task so that  you can easily add repositories to Ginatra. Use
the following to add repositories to Ginatra, without fear of getting it wrong:

    $ rake add repo='git://github.com/lenary/ginatra.git'
    $ rake add repo='git://github.com/mojombo/grit.git' name='fun'
