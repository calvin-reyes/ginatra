This project  is to make a  clone of gitweb in  Ruby and Sinatra. It  serves git
repositories out of a set of  specified directories using an array of glob-based
paths. I have plans to make it  function just as gitweb does, including leeching
config files and suchlike.

Installation
------------

**NEW: You should be using Ruby 1.9.2: because it's awesome!**

To install ginatra:

    $ gem install ginatra
    ...
    $ ginatra setup
    checked deps
    installed config

If you get those two lines of output, you're sorted. anything else and something
has gone wrong.

### External Dependencies

You should be using Git 1.6.3 or later just to be sure that it all works:

    $ git --version
    git version 1.6.3

The other dependency you need is pygments, an awesome python syntax highlighter.
To check whether you have it, run:

    $ which pygmentize

If this returns a path pointing to a 'pygmentize' binary, then you're all set.
If not you'll need to install pygments. Look at the last section of the
[jekyll wiki "install" page](http://wiki.github.com/mojombo/jekyll/install)
to see how to install it. Also make sure again that the `pygmentize` binary
is on your path.

If you want to play around with the code, you can clone the repository. This also allows you
to use a special rackup file to mount it where you wish. I am yet to sort out some of the
details of running Ginatra from a gem with a rackup.ru file.

Usage
-----

If you're just using it in development, use the following to start, check and stop Ginatra
respectively:

    $ ginatra server start
    $ ginatra server status
    $ ginatra server stop

Ginatra  also runs  on thin, with the approach outlined above.

**BEWARE:** There are issues running Ginatra on Passenger. We discourage Ginatra's use
on Passenger until we can make it stable.

Ginatra can also start a git-daemon serving all the repositories that ginatra serves:

    $ ginatra daemon start
    $ ginatra daemon status
    $ ginatra daemon stop

This runs on the default git daemon port.

You can add a glob specified list of git repositories for ginatra to serve using the
following commands:

    $ ginatra directory add '~/Git/ginatra/*'
    $ ginatra directory list
    $ ginatra directory remove '~/Git/ginatra/*'

These should be fairly self explanatory. Help is shown with either the --help option
or by not specifying a sub-command like start, status, stop, add, list or remove.
