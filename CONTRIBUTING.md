# How to contribute

In the spirit of open source software, **everyone** is encouraged to help
improve this project.

## Your Pull Request

To make it easy to review and understand your change please keep the following
things in mind before submitting your pull request:

* Work on the latest possible state of **ginatra/master**
* Create a branch which is dedicated to your change
* Test your changes before creating a pull request (`bundle exec rake`)
* If possible write a test case which confirms your change
* Don't mix several features or bug-fixes in one pull request
* Create a meaningful commit message
* Explain your change (i.e. with a link to the issue you are fixing)
* Keep it simple: don't overcomplicate things and add extra dependencies unless
  you have a *special* reason

**IMPORTANT**:

Before you start working on a larger contribution, you should get in touch first
through the issue tracker with your idea so that the project's developers can
help out and possibly guide you. Coordinating up front makes it much easier to
avoid frustration later on.
