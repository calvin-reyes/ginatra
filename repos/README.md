From the top README:

> To clone repositories so that Ginatra  can see them, clone the repositories into `./repos/` - they will be served  automatically. Use the `--bare` switch to both save space and  make sure Ginatra can  read them. If you rename  them, make sure the directory ends in `.git'. For Example:
> 
>     cd repos
>     git clone --bare git://github.com/lenary/ginatra.git
>     git clone --bare git://github.com/mojombo/grit.git fun.git
