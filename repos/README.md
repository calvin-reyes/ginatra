To make Ginatra see repositories, put them into this directory. You can do this
by several ways:

1. Clone repository here

    git clone git://github.com/NARKOZ/ginatra.git

2. Symlink repository into there

    ln -s /path/to/repo repos/

3. Copy repository here

    cp -R /path/to/repo repos/

4. Move repository here

    mv -R /path/to/repo repos/

Run `ginatra --help` for additional command line help and see `config.yml` file
for available settings.
